### Php Express
This project is a light weight version of the popular expressjs Nodejs framework.

### About
While this is similar to Expressjs, this project does not attempt to do everything that Expressjs does. For example regex 
route matching is currently not supported, however named params are.

The project is designed for Apache with mod_rewrite support required. NGINX support is not included, but that could be 
added if required. 

### Composer
This project requires composer for autoloading.

### Tests
Some tests have been written using PHPUnit, there is currently some minor refactoring required to make this project testable. 
This is because the program depends on Apache or similar webserver to glean data such as the current URL. This data will need
to be mocked during testing.

### TODO
Include JSON schema validation of request body data.

### Example usage
This example usage is included in the `/api/index.php` file and is presented here for the benfit of readers.
